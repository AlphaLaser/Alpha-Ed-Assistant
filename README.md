# Alpha-Ed-Assistant

## Inspiration

- Thousands of communities in the world today don't have access to education.

- Sometimes, people do have an idea or want to build their own educational startup but don't have acces to the knowledge required to do so, or can't arrange finances

- Alpha Ed Assist aims to provide a solution to that

## What it does

- Has a Natural Language Processing chatbot built with Python to solve a user's queries regarding the opening of an educational institute/school

- Has a Sponsor Portfolio page where you can:-
   --> Connect with sponsors through the Whatsapp API
   --> Visit a sponsor's website
   --> View a sponsor's offerings through color-coded tags

-  Integrates all of this through an aesthetic User Interface
